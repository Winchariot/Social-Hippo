# Social-Hippo
This hippo doesn't lurk in muddy rivers devouring grass--it delivers HUGE content ideas for your personal or brand social media posts. Social Hippo is a lightweight social media content generator and assistant.

Opening Social Hippo gives you a list of noteworthy events happening today--anything from holidays to meteor showers to celebrity birthdays--and empowers YOU to make topical, entertaining social media posts to further your brand.

Each event on Social Hippo comes with a short description of the event, including background and ideas for celebrating, so you have the knowledge you need to impress and delight your followers while avoiding embarrassing social media flubs. Events also include a link to Read More, a handful of hashtags related to the event, and a related image from Flickr as further inspiration for content for your posts.

From an event, there are buttons to post directly to Facebook or Twitter if enabled on your device, or to open Instagram if you have the app installed.

This product uses the Flickr API but is not endorsed or certified by Flickr.

You will need to create a keys.plist file and generate a Flickr API key in order to get photos for an event.
